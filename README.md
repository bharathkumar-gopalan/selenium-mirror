# Introduction 
A while ago a friend of mine asked if there is a way to replay what is is doing in a browser in another browser in real time . I wrote this proof of concept 

This project consists of two parts 
1. A spring boot based Restful service that provides endpoints that drive a browser via selenium grid 
2. A chrome plugin that records the user action and sends the request to the REST service 

# How to use
Coming soon...
